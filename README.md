## üîß Storage Management

### First-Boot Wizard
The system includes an interactive first-boot wizard that:
- Creates your initial user account with sudo privileges
- Configures basic system settings (timezone, hostname)
- Initializes security tools and lab environments
- Sets up storage management features

### Btrfs Snapshots
Automated snapshot management with:
- Daily snapshots of root and home filesystems
- Configurable retention (default: 7 days)
- Space-efficient copy-on-write storage
- Easy restore from snapshots

```bash
# Create manual snapshot
kawaiisec-snapshot.sh create root

# List available snapshots
kawaiisec-snapshot.sh list home

# Restore from snapshot
kawaiisec-snapshot.sh restore root snapshot_name
```

### OverlayFS Support
For educational environments requiring system reset:
- Read-only base system with writable overlay
- Easy reset to clean state between sessions
- Reduced wear on storage devices

```bash
# Setup OverlayFS
kawaiisec-overlay-setup.sh setup

# Reset system to clean state
kawaiisec-mount-overlay.sh reset
```

### Disk Quotas
Prevent disk space exhaustion with:
- Per-user quotas (default: 5GB soft, 6GB hard)
- Group quotas for shared projects
- Automated monitoring and alerts
- Grace periods for soft limit violations

```bash
# Setup quotas
kawaiisec-quota-setup.sh setup

# Add quota for user
kawaiisec-quota-setup.sh add-user alice /home 3G 4G

# Check quota usage
kawaiisec-quota-setup.sh report /home
```

### Automated Cleanup
Daily maintenance tasks include:
- Temporary file cleanup
- Package cache management
- Log rotation and compression
- Old snapshot removal

```bash
# Run manual cleanup
kawaiisec-cleanup.sh all

# Preview what would be cleaned
kawaiisec-cleanup.sh dry-run
```

### Account Security Management
Robust system for detecting and removing demo/test accounts:

```bash
# Scan for suspicious accounts (safe)
make account-cleanup

# Create configuration files
make account-cleanup-config

# Remove suspicious accounts (with confirmation)
make account-cleanup-force

# Lock accounts instead of removing (safer)
make account-cleanup-lock
```
