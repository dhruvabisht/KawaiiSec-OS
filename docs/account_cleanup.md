# ðŸ§¹ KawaiiSec OS Account Cleanup System

## Overview

The KawaiiSec OS Account Cleanup System is a robust security tool designed to detect, document, and remove demo/test accounts before packaging and release. This system helps ensure that no unauthorized or temporary accounts remain in production deployments.

## Features

- **Automated Detection**: Scans for accounts matching suspicious patterns (demo, test, guest, etc.)
- **Safety First**: Dry-run mode by default - no changes made without explicit consent
- **Whitelist Support**: Protects legitimate accounts that match suspicious patterns
- **Multiple Removal Options**: Choose between account removal or account locking
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All actions are logged with timestamps and details
- **Interactive & Automated Modes**: Supports both manual confirmation and batch processing
- **Detailed Reporting**: Generates comprehensive reports of all actions taken

## Quick Start

### 1. Basic Scan (Safe)
```bash
# Scan for suspicious accounts without making changes
make account-cleanup
# or
sudo kawaiisec-account-cleanup.sh scan
```

### 2. Create Configuration Files
```bash
# Generate default configuration and whitelist files
make account-cleanup-config
# or
kawaiisec-account-cleanup.sh config
```

### 3. Edit Whitelist (Important!)
```bash
# Add legitimate accounts to protect them
sudo nano /etc/kawaiisec/account_whitelist.txt
```

### 4. Remove Suspicious Accounts
```bash
# DESTRUCTIVE: Permanently removes accounts
make account-cleanup-force
# or
sudo kawaiisec-account-cleanup.sh --force cleanup

# SAFER: Just lock/disable accounts
make account-cleanup-lock
# or
sudo kawaiisec-account-cleanup.sh --lock-only --force cleanup
```

## Suspicious Account Patterns

The system automatically flags accounts matching these patterns (case-insensitive):

- `demo` - Demo accounts
- `test` - Test accounts  
- `student` - Student accounts
- `guest` - Guest accounts
- `temp` - Temporary accounts
- `lab` - Lab accounts
- `kali` - Default Kali accounts
- `user` - Generic user accounts
- `admin` - Generic admin accounts
- `pentest` - Penetration testing accounts
- `training` - Training accounts
- `workshop` - Workshop accounts
- `example` - Example accounts
- `sample` - Sample accounts
- `trial` - Trial accounts

## Account Whitelist System

### Purpose
The whitelist protects legitimate accounts that might match suspicious patterns (e.g., a real instructor account named "demo-instructor").

### Configuration File
Location: `/etc/kawaiisec/account_whitelist.txt`

### Format
```bash
# KawaiiSec OS Account Whitelist
# One account name per line
# Lines starting with # are comments

instructor
teacher
admin-real
staff
kawaiisec-admin
```

### Example Legitimate Accounts
- `instructor` - Course instructor
- `teacher` - Teaching staff
- `admin-real` - Legitimate administrator
- `staff` - Staff accounts
- `kawaiisec-admin` - KawaiiSec system administrator
- `demo-instructor` - Legitimate demo instructor account
- `lab-coordinator` - Lab coordinator account

## Command Line Usage

### Basic Commands
```bash
# Scan for suspicious accounts (dry-run)
kawaiisec-account-cleanup.sh scan

# Process suspicious accounts interactively
kawaiisec-account-cleanup.sh cleanup

# Create configuration files
kawaiisec-account-cleanup.sh config

# Show help
kawaiisec-account-cleanup.sh --help
```

### Options
```bash
--dry-run           # Show what would be done (default)
--force             # Actually remove/lock accounts
--lock-only         # Lock accounts instead of removing
--interactive       # Prompt for each account (default)
--non-interactive   # No prompts (for automation)
--config FILE       # Use custom configuration file
--whitelist FILE    # Use custom whitelist file
```

### Examples
```bash
# Safe scan
kawaiisec-account-cleanup.sh

# Interactive removal
kawaiisec-account-cleanup.sh --force cleanup

# Lock accounts instead of removing
kawaiisec-account-cleanup.sh --lock-only --force cleanup

# Automated removal (no prompts)
kawaiisec-account-cleanup.sh --non-interactive --force cleanup

# Use custom whitelist
kawaiisec-account-cleanup.sh --whitelist /path/to/whitelist.txt scan
```

## Makefile Integration

### Available Targets

```bash
# Safe scanning
make account-cleanup                # Dry-run scan
make account-cleanup-status         # Show system status

# Configuration
make account-cleanup-config         # Create config files

# Account processing (requires confirmation)
make account-cleanup-force          # Remove accounts permanently
make account-cleanup-lock           # Lock accounts (safer)
```

### Pre-Release Integration

Add account cleanup to your release process:

```bash
# In your build/release script
make account-cleanup-config         # Ensure config exists
make account-cleanup                # Scan for issues
# Review results, update whitelist if needed
make account-cleanup-force          # Clean up before packaging
```

## Logging and Reporting

### Log File
Location: `/var/log/kawaiisec-account-cleanup.log`

Contains detailed information about:
- All scan results
- Account processing actions
- Errors and warnings
- Timestamps for all operations

### Report Generation
Each run generates a comprehensive report in `/tmp/` with:
- Summary statistics
- Configuration details
- List of suspicious patterns checked
- Whitelist status
- Detailed log excerpts

Reports are also copied to the user's home directory when run with sudo.

## Safety Features

### 1. Dry-Run by Default
- No changes made without explicit `--force` flag
- Shows exactly what would be done
- Allows review before actual changes

### 2. Whitelist Protection
- Prevents removal of legitimate accounts
- Easy to configure and maintain
- Checked before any account processing

### 3. Interactive Confirmation
- Prompts for each account by default
- Shows account details before processing
- Options: Yes/No/Skip/Quit

### 4. Comprehensive Logging
- All actions logged with timestamps
- Detailed account information recorded
- Error tracking and reporting

### 5. Multiple Processing Options
- **Remove**: Permanently delete account and home directory
- **Lock**: Disable login but preserve data
- **Skip**: Leave account unchanged

## Configuration Files

### Main Configuration
File: `/etc/kawaiisec/account-cleanup.conf`

```bash
# KawaiiSec OS Account Cleanup Configuration
# Default behavior
DRY_RUN=true
FORCE_REMOVAL=false
INTERACTIVE=true
LOCK_ONLY=false

# Logging
LOG_FILE="/var/log/kawaiisec-account-cleanup.log"

# Additional suspicious patterns
CUSTOM_SUSPICIOUS_PATTERNS=(
    # Add custom patterns here
)
```

### Account Whitelist
File: `/etc/kawaiisec/account_whitelist.txt`

Simple text file with one account name per line. Comments start with `#`.

## Integration with Package Building

### Debian Package Integration
The account cleanup system is automatically configured during package installation:

1. Configuration files are created
2. Default whitelist is installed
3. Initial scan is performed
4. System is ready for use

### CI/CD Integration
Example workflow for automated testing:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions step
- name: Test Account Cleanup
  run: |
    # Create test accounts
    sudo useradd demo-test
    sudo useradd student-test
    sudo useradd legitimate-user
    
    # Add legitimate account to whitelist
    echo "legitimate-user" | sudo tee -a /etc/kawaiisec/account_whitelist.txt
    
    # Run cleanup
    sudo kawaiisec-account-cleanup.sh --non-interactive --force cleanup
    
    # Verify results
    ! id demo-test 2>/dev/null      # Should be removed
    ! id student-test 2>/dev/null   # Should be removed
    id legitimate-user              # Should remain
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Script Not Found
```bash
# Error: Account cleanup script not found
# Solution: Ensure script is executable and in PATH
chmod +x scripts/kawaiisec-account-cleanup.sh
sudo cp scripts/kawaiisec-account-cleanup.sh /usr/local/bin/
```

#### 2. Permission Denied
```bash
# Error: Permission denied
# Solution: Run with sudo for account management
sudo kawaiisec-account-cleanup.sh scan
```

#### 3. Legitimate Account Removed
```bash
# Problem: Important account was accidentally removed
# Solution: Add to whitelist and restore from backup
echo "important-account" >> /etc/kawaiisec/account_whitelist.txt
# Restore account from system backup
```

#### 4. No Accounts Found
```bash
# If no suspicious accounts are found but you expect some:
# 1. Check if accounts have UID >= 1000
# 2. Verify account names match suspicious patterns
# 3. Check if accounts are already in whitelist
kawaiisec-account-cleanup.sh --help  # Review patterns
```

### Log Analysis
```bash
# View recent activity
tail -f /var/log/kawaiisec-account-cleanup.log

# Search for specific account
grep "username" /var/log/kawaiisec-account-cleanup.log

# View error messages
grep "ERROR" /var/log/kawaiisec-account-cleanup.log
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Pre-Release Checklist
- [ ] Review and update account whitelist
- [ ] Run account scan and review results  
- [ ] Test whitelist protection
- [ ] Run cleanup in dry-run mode first
- [ ] Verify all legitimate accounts are preserved
- [ ] Check log files for any issues
- [ ] Generate and review cleanup report

### 2. Whitelist Management
- Keep whitelist up-to-date with legitimate accounts
- Document why each account is whitelisted
- Review whitelist regularly
- Use descriptive account names to avoid false positives

### 3. Testing Strategy
- Always test in a non-production environment first
- Create test accounts matching suspicious patterns
- Verify whitelist protection works correctly
- Test both interactive and non-interactive modes

### 4. Automation Integration
- Include account cleanup in CI/CD pipelines
- Run scans regularly during development
- Automate whitelist updates when adding legitimate accounts
- Generate reports for security audits

## Security Considerations

### 1. Account Verification
- Verify account ownership before removal
- Check for active processes or services
- Review home directory contents
- Confirm accounts are actually unauthorized

### 2. Data Preservation
- Consider using lock mode instead of removal for sensitive accounts
- Backup important data before account removal
- Document removal decisions for audit trails

### 3. System Impact
- Be aware that removing accounts may affect running services
- Check for cron jobs, systemd services, or other dependencies
- Test account removal in staging environment first

## Contributing

### Adding Suspicious Patterns
To add new suspicious account patterns:
